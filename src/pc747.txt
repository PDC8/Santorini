Throughout the assignment, I learned that object orientated programming is a lot of planning rather than just straight put coding based on the spec. I realized that after taking the time to plan out how to use the design patterns and where we would put them in the assignment it was easier and went more smoothly. This experience emphasized the importance of design patterns in OOP and by incorporating design patterns into our code, it provided a blueprint for organizing code in a way that is flexible, extensible, and easier to follow/read. I also learned that VSCode has a very nice feature called Liveshare which made the whole pair-programming process go smoothly.
